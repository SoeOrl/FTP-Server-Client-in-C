FTP Server (Lab 2)
Language: C
Tested on: Fedora 29 Server, csegrid

How to:

To begin download and unzip the files in the location of your choice. 
The file Server.c contains the source code for the server, and the file
Client.c contains all the code for the client. 

To build the binaries, simply run make in the extracted directory.
This will build two binaries, Server and Client.
To run the server simply type ./Server, the server will listen on port 1588
To run the client simply type ./Client <location>, the client will try to contact
the server running on port 1588. Example usage: ./Client localhost

All functionality as per the requirements are implemented.
